          Who can join and what are your application criteria?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          We are very much no-nonsense. We are looking for individual
          excellence. We will not put you through a cumbersome coffee chat and
          tiered interview process. If you have built something yourself,
          describe it in our application and provide as many links as possible.
          If you are experienced, but not in getting your own project going,
          that is fine. Many of us are proficient computer science, engineering,
          data science, business or design (in some sort) majors, because
          eventually, we are developing products. There is so much work to be
          done in AI ethics for example, so we are actively looking for help in
          that domain.

        <AccordionTrigger>What do we actually do?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Our mission follows one goal: Help you build your AI product. It is a
          non-bullshit club in which you get to choose on what you would like to
          work on. For that, we have established three main pillars: Community,
          Projects, and Education. Community: After interviewing 30+ experienced
          founders and AI-experts, we realised that they mainly want to meet
          other like-minded people. So we are creating an atmosphere for that by
          organizing a weekly hacking and networking on Sunday afternoons. Dates
          and Location to be announced soon. Moreover, we will hold our first
          multi-day Hackathon in April this year. We also count on our community
          to deliver high-quality workshops on prompt-engineering, AI ethics and
          alignment research and generative AI. Projects: By collaborating with
          VCs, start-ups and industry leaders to build Machine Learning
          products. Typically, our teams are comprised of one PM and two to
          three members. Every project is going to be different - it is possible
          to spin a company. This is the exact opposite of the consulting club
          experience. Instead of working for the client, your building with him.
          Your fast track to PM and entrepreneurship. Also, we are building a
          research track to push the boundaries of state-of-the-art models with
          precise applications in mind. Education: We initially aimed to focus
          on education just as much as building an innovative community and
          offering exciting projects. While we will hold workshops and welcome
          guest speakers for direct advice and interactions, our broader vision
          to educate a broader audience will start in future semesters.

          How are we different from ML@B or SCET?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          UC Berkeley offers a myriad of ways to conduct AI research - Machine
          Learning @ Berkeley, BAIR, CHAI, and PhD programs of all kind. But
          here, you learn to do research, get recruited into the industry or, at
          the most, work on your advisors start-up. We have the world leading
          computer science program. At the same time, SCET offers great
          resources in form of accelerator programs. These, on the other hand,
          focus on general start-up. We focus on the most important domain of
          the century: AI.

          How do I apply and when is the deadline?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          We have a deadline set (see above), but love the more flexible
          Y-Combinator approach. So if you would like to join throughout the
          semester, please reach out.

        <AccordionTrigger>What is our long-term vision?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          We strive to launch our own Decal, start our own incubator, and our
          own fellowship program. Let us know if you are incredibly passionate
          in building any of these. Experience in education and venture capital
          ideal for these sakes.
